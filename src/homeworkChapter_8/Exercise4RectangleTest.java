//8.4 (Rectangle Class)
// Create a class Rectangle with attributes length and width, each of which defaults to 1.
// Provide methods that calculate the rectangleâ€™s perimeter and area.
// It has set and get methods for both length and width.
// The set methods should verify that length and width are each floating-point numbers larger than 0.0 and less than 20.0.
// Write a program to test class Rectangle.
