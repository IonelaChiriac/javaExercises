//5.16 (Bar Chart Printing Program)
// One interesting application of computers is to display graphs and bar charts.
// Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30.
// For each number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent asterisks.
// For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******.
// Display the bars of asterisks after you read all five numbers.
